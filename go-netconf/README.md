# Go-NETCONF

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/vinpatel24/go-netconf)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/vinpatel24/go-netconf)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vinpatel24/go-netconf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vinpatel24/go-netconf)

This library is a simple NETCONF client based on [RFC6241](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6241) and [RFC6242](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6242) (although not fully compliant yet).

> **Note:** This library is a fork of the Juniper go-netconf library. This fork is open to pull requests and suggestions. Libraries like this should be easy to use and this library has a nicer abstraction layer using a 'Driver' interface. This is work-in-progress.

## Features
* Support for SSH transport using go.crypto/ssh. (Other transports are planned).
* Built in RPC support (in progress).
* Support for custom RPCs.
* Independent of XML library.  Free to choose encoding/xml or another third party library to parse the results.

## Install
* Requires Go 1.4 or later
* Tests pass for 1.8 and later using Travis-CI (this is WIP)
* Please use `git clone` because this is a library and not an application

```bash
go get github.com/vinpatel24/go-netconf
```

## Example
* See examples in `examples/` directory.

This is the interface that `go-netconf` uses.

```go
// Driver interface for building drivers that are self-contained from a user's perspective.
type Driver interface {
	Lock(ds string) (*rpc.RPCReply, error)
	Unlock(ds string) (*rpc.RPCReply, error)

	Close() error
	Dial() error
	DialTimeout() error
	SendRaw(rawxml string) (*rpc.RPCReply, error)
	GetConfig() (*rpc.RPCReply, error)
}
```

Please note, that two transport types exist; one for direct use on Junos and the other socket based over SSH. This driver mechanism promotes the easy interchange of lower level transports without messing about.
